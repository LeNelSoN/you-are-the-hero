# How to Create a Pull Request (PR)
After making changes to your forked repository and pushing your branch, follow these steps to create a Pull Request (PR) and propose your changes to the original project:

## Navigate to the Original Repository:

Go to the original repository where you want to submit your changes. In this case, it will be [L'API dont vous Ãªtes le hÃ©ros](https://github.com/LeNelSoN/you-are-the-hero).
## Start a New Pull Request:

Click on the "Pull Requests" tab at the top of the repository.
Click on the "New Pull Request" button.
## Choose Your Branch:

On the "Compare changes" page, select your forked repository and the branch you worked on (your-feature-branch) from the dropdown menu on the right.
Make sure to compare it with the main branch (or the appropriate base branch) of the original repository.
## Review the Changes:

Review the changes that will be submitted. GitHub will display a list of commits and the files that have been modified.
Ensure that only relevant changes are included in your PR.
## Add a Descriptive Title and Description:

In the "Title" field, provide a short and descriptive title for your PR (e.g., "Fix issue #123: Correct typo in README").
In the "Description" field, explain your changes in detail. Mention any issues your PR fixes (use keywords like "fixes" or "closes" followed by the issue number, e.g., fixes #123) and any context that might help reviewers understand your changes.
## Submit the Pull Request:

Once everything is ready, click "Create Pull Request."
Your PR is now submitted for review by the project maintainers!
## Participate in the Discussion:

Be prepared to answer any questions or make changes if needed. Reviewers may request modifications before your PR can be merged.
## Merge:

Once your PR is approved, a maintainer will merge it into the projectâ€™s main codebase. ðŸŽ‰
